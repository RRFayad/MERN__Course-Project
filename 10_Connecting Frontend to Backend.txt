Main Goals:
    - Send HTTP Requests and Use Response Data
    - Handle Erros and loading State
    - Update User Interface

Big Steps:

    * Max adjusted the DB Url to start a new one
    
    
    1.  Create user (sign up method)
        * mainly because we need the user for the other data logic in the Models

        * It will return a error of CORS
            ** CORS is a security mechanism for the backend only accept requests from the same server (which obviously conflicts with an API idea)
    
    2. BackEnd: Add the CORS Middleware

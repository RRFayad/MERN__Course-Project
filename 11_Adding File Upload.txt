Main Goals:
    - Accept & Handle Files
    - Add a FIle Picker in the Front End

Main Steps:
    1. Build the ImageUpload Component (FrontEnd)
        ** Auth Page & NewPlaces
        * <Input type= "file" accept= ".jpg,.png,.jpeg" />


    2. Set Up the Back end (Multer) 
        * Files are bynary data - that's why we need to set multer up

Main Goals:
    - Accept & Handle Files
    - Add a FIle Picker in the Front End

Main Steps:

    1. Set Up:
        
        A. Build the ImageUpload Component (FrontEnd)
            ** Auth Page & NewPlaces
            Set the Input <Input type= "file" accept= ".jpg,.png,.jpeg" />
            
        B. Set Up the Back end (Multer) 
            * Files are bynary data - that's why we need to set multer up
            * We created the file-upload middleware and set it up in the routes, before it reaches the controller

    2. Wire the FrontEnd and BackEnd up
        * FrontEnd
                ** Check Auth - signUp()
            - Set the Request - Where we set the new FormData that allows us to handle with binary data (files)
            
        * BackEnd
            - We want to create an URL for a image
                - Controller (sign up in this case)
                - Serving the image ()
            - And Handle Error - RollBack the file creation
                - We created a logic in our error handler in App, that if the Req has a file, it will delete it from the path
                    - So we don't need the handle error for each controller or each possible error
            - Create a middleware to let a browser reach files in the server (for a specific path)
    
    3. Remember to set logic for deleting the file, when deleting the Place
        * Just a fs.unlink() logic

Main Goals:
    - Accept & Handle Files
    - Add a FIle Picker in the Front End

Main Steps:
    1. Build the ImageUpload Component (FrontEnd)
        ** Auth Page & NewPlaces
        * <Input type= "file" accept= ".jpg,.png,.jpeg" />


    2. Set Up the Back end (Multer) 
        * Files are bynary data - that's why we need to set multer up
        * We created the file-upload middleware and set it up in the routes, before it reaches the controller

    3. Wire the FrontEnd and BackEnd up
        * FrontEnd
            - Check Auth - signUp() - Where we set the new FormData
            -
        * BackEnd
            - We want to create an URL for a image
                - Controller (sign up in this case)
                - Serving the image ()
            - And Handle Error - RollBack the file creation
                - We created a logic in our error handler in App, that if the Req has a file, it will delete it from the path
            - Create a middleware to let a browser reach files in the server (for a specific path)

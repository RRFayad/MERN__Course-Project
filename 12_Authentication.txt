Main Goals:
    - Setu Up Authentication
    - Set Up Authorization

How Should it Work
    - The server generates a Token, which can be stored in the FrontEnd in a Cookie or Local Storage
        * Traditionally (HTML rendered from the server) we use Session and sessoin Id (cookie)
    
Main Steps:
    
    1. Hash the Password (bcrypt)
        a. install bcrypt
        b. Set bcrypt for the sign up and for the login
    
    2. Generate JWT in the Backend (jsonwebtoken)
        a. install and set up the controllers (again sign up and login)
    
    3. Create and Add the middleware for token verification
        * We set to token to be checked in the Header (as it's metaData and not every req has body)

    4. Set Up Front End for thw JWT
        - Handle the token
            (also we don't need to handle the loggedIn staate anymore, it's just a !!token)

40. Starting Setup, Pages & Routes

    - Folders Strucutute:
        - A folder per feature (*places and users in our case)
            - Each one containing a folder for pages and another for components
        - A folder for shared components
    
    - As Max have already planned the pages, he likes to start with the pages folder

    Steps.:
        1. Install the Router
            npm install --save react-router-dom@5 --save-exact
        2. Organize the Pages Components
        3. Organize the App as a Router, with the pages components
            a. import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Redirect, Switch } from "react-router-dom";
                * Router is for the 'ROuter system';
                * Route for each Route
                * Redirect for redirecting
                * Switch Is to make sure we only redirect when we do not find a path
     
     
            <Router>
                <Switch>
                    <Route path="/" exact>
                    <Users />
                    </Route>
                    <Route path="/places/new" exact>
                    <NewPlace />
                    </Route>
                    <Redirect to="/" />
                </Switch>
            </Router>

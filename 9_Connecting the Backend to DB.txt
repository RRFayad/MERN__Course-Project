123. Module Introduction
    - Defining Mongoose Models

    - CRUD Operations

    - Connecting Places & Users (Relations)

Steps:
    Work in the places controllers:

    1. Install Mongoose & Connect it our Backend to MongoDB 
        
        - npm install --save mongoose

        - Import it in the app

    2. Create the Models

        * Mongo DB => Collections => Documents
        * Mongoose => Schema (blueprint of a document) => Model (each instance will generate a new document)

    3. Develop the CRUD Logic - The Controller

        - Create: 
            - createPlace Logic
                - Nothing new, used the Model to instancing the new Place, and the save(), that comes from mongoose

        - Read:
            - getPlaceById Logic 
            - getPlacesByUserId
                * note the return toObject({getters:true})
            
        - Update:
            - Actually, exactly the same as Read and the Create (save())

        - Delete
            - Nothing new here, but the remove()


    4. Work in Users
        * Treated this separetedly because it has its own observations:

        - npm install --save mongoose-unique-validator
            * To ensure i a efficient way that there will be not duplicate e-mail on the DB
